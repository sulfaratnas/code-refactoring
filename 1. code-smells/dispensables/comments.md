# Comments

## What It Looks Like

Comments are usually created with the best of intentions, when the author realizes that his or her code isnâ€™t intuitive or obvious. In such cases, comments are like a deodorant masking the smell of fishy code that could be improved.

```
// Calculate adds two numbers and returns the result.
func Calculate(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

func main() {
    result := Calculate(5, 10)

    fmt.Println("The result is:", result)
}
```
In this example, the Calculate function has a name that's not very descriptive, so a comment is added to explain its purpose. This is a code smell because the method name should ideally be clear enough to convey its purpose without needing a comment.


## Why It Hurts

Redundant comments don't improve code readability.

## How To Fix It

If a comment is intended to explain a complex expression, the expression should be split into understandable subexpressions using [Extract Variable](.././../2.%20refactorings/extract-variable.md).

If a comment explains a section of code, this section can be turned into a separate method via [Extract Method](.././../2.%20refactorings/extract-method.md). The name of the new method can be taken from the comment text itself, most likely.

If a method has already been extracted, but comments are still necessary to explain what the method does, give the method a self-explanatory name. Use [Rename Method](.././../2.%20refactorings/rename-method.md) for this.

## Refactor

```
func AddNumbers(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

func main() {
    sum := AddNumbers(5, 10)
    fmt.Println("Sum:", sum)
}
```

## Payoff

Code becomes more intuitive and obvious.
